# Spiral-arm-motion-calculator
This code aims to offer an easy way to calculate the location of spiral arms of a protoplanetary disk and calculate the motion between different epochs.

The main code is the file 'calculator.py', please import it while using. 
The 'main.py' and the 'main.ipynb' are examples to deproject a disk figure, fit the locations of the centers of spiral arms, and calculate the motion between figures from different epochs.
